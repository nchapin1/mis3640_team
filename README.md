## Program Overview
This program is designed to allow a user to input the cryptocurrencies of their choice with specific parameters, such as target return and loss tolerance. The program will track the cryptocurrencies' current market prices and will send a email notification that specifies which assets appreciate or depreciate past these points.  

## Program Instructions
To begin, create a user account. Insert the desired parameters and click the add button on the home page to create a tracker. To delete a tracked asset, simply press the remove button.
